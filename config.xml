	Fonts:
	Normal is the font that the game uses for text.
	Fixed is for a monospaced font for tabular info but nothing currently uses that.
	ShowPercent determines whether or not % is placed
		after the number for stats and skills on the girl details list.
	Antialias determines whether font antialiasing (smoothing) is used.

	It's worth leaving these in, since once the XML screen format is stable,
		it will be possible to set custom fonts for different text elements,
		just like designing a web page.
	Except that you'll have to distribute the font with the game or mod
		rather than relying on the viewer to have it pre-installed.
