        You seem to have too few nurses that provide care for your patients after their operation.
        This has negative effects on ${name}'s health.

            ${name}'s health condition does not allow surgery to be performed.
            Your highly qualified nursing staff are making sure she gets well enough for her treatment soon.

            ${name}'s health condition does not allow surgery to be performed, and with no nurses around
            it may take a long time for her to get better. All she can do is rest.
